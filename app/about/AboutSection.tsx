      <h1 className="font-bold text-2xl p-4">About Me</h1>
      <p className="font-serif text-left">
        I am a full stack developer with a passion for building web
        applications. I feel at my best when challenged to think and solve
        difficult problems, so I view software engineering as a medium for
        accomplishing that.
      </p>
      <p className="my-6 text-left">
        Over the past 2 years, I have honed my skills in both front-end and
        back-end development across various endeavors of mine. I am currently
        building on an online e-commerce marketplace for skateboarders. While it
        began just for personal learning, I now plan to scale the platform to
        get real active users that can make transactions with it. This long term
        project has taught me many valuable lessons about writing clean and
        testable code that scales in production.
      </p>
      <p className="my-6"></p>I also love working collaboratively in fast paced
      work environments, and have the experience to back it up. As a Full Stack
      React Native Developer at SeekEats, I helped build out the mobile app's
      features in a large codebase alongside various other developers. I made
      pull requests, participated in code reviews, and also implemented feedback
      from the design and product teams in order improve the app's functionality
      and performance. In addition to developing apps myself, I also teach web
      development and computer science concepts at 2U, an online education
      platform that partners with leading universities. As a retained
      instructional specialist across 4 cohorts, I facilitated student learning
      through class assignments and collaborative projects that utilize Agile
      software development and Git version control. I leverage my knowledge of
      various web technologies, such as Express.js, SQL, MongoDB, HTML, CSS,
      REST APIs, and GraphQL, to communicate with the class, answer questions,
      and problem solve. I am responsible for ensuring that students are
      satisfied with the class material, instructional support, and given the
      best resources to succeed in the industry. My background spans from
      biology to skateboarding, allowing me to offer both a scientific and
      creative outlook on the projects I am involved with. I have a Bachelor's
      degree in Biology/Biological Sciences and an Honors Minor in
      Interdisciplinary Studies from San Diego State University, where I
      graduated cum laude in December 2021. I also have a Certificate in Full
      Stack Web Development from UC San Diego. Throughout my experiences, I have
      been commended by professors, peers, and employers for my thorough
      attention to detail and interpersonal skills. I am now looking to bring my
      skill set and tenacious work ethic to a company where I can grow and
      become a valuable asset.
