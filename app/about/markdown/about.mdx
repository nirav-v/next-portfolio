I'm **Nirav**, a Full Stack Software Engineer passionate about
crafting scalable, high-impact applications that merge functionality with
seamless user experiences.

But beyond software, here's some fun stuff about me:

</p>{' '}

- I grew up in the Silicon Valley, spent 6 years of my life sunny San Diego, and just recently made the move back up to **San Francisco**! 

- My curiosity extends to science, history, and philosophy. You can always find me reading a book or listening to a podcast in these one of these areas. 📚🌎

- In recent years, I’ve dived deep into the world of fitness and health optimization, always exploring ways to improve both physically and mentally. 🏋️ 

- I have a love for skateboarding and snowboarding — these outlets have shaped my creativity, discipline, and ability to navigate challenges—both on the board and in my work. 🛹🏂

- When I’m not coding or absorbing knowledge, I’m spending spending time with my loved ones and Dogs, who make sure I take enough breaks. 🐾
