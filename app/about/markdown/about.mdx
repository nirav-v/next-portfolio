I'm **Nirav Venkatesan**, a Full Stack Software Engineer passionate about  
crafting **scalable, high-impact applications** that merge functionality  
with seamless user experiences. Here are some of the applications I have worked on:

- [Rentius.ai](https://rentius.ai) ‚Äì An AI-powered platform that helps landlords manage their rental properties and tenant communications.

- [Symphony Partners](https://www.symphonypartners.ca/) ‚Äì The corporate website I built while working for them.
  {' '}

  Beyond software, I have a lifelong love for **skateboarding and snowboarding**,
  which have shaped my creativity, discipline, and ability to navigate challenges‚Äîboth
  on the board and in my work.

More recently, I‚Äôve dived deep into **fitness and health optimization**, always exploring ways to improve both physically and mentally.

My curiosity extends to **science, history, and philosophy**,

When I‚Äôm not coding or absorbing knowledge, I‚Äôm spending time with my **two German Shepherds**, who make sure I take enough breaks. üêæ
